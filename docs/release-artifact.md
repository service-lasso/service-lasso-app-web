# Release artifacts

This repo now ships three bounded release artifacts.

Each artifact has a different job:
- source template
- runnable bootstrap-download bundle
- runnable preloaded bundle

## Source template

Artifact:
- `service-lasso-app-web-<version>-source.tar.gz`

Purpose:
- give downstream teams a downloadable starter repo shape
- keep tracked `services/` metadata in the template repo itself

What ships:
- `.gitignore`
- `.npmrc`
- `.github/`
- `README.md`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `src/`
- `services/`
- `docs/`
- `scripts/`
- `tests/`
- generated `release-artifact.json`

Honest label:
- **starter-template source artifact**

## Runnable bootstrap-download bundle

Artifact:
- `service-lasso-app-web-<version>-runtime.tar.gz`

Purpose:
- provide a ready-to-run browser-first host with the core runtime already installed
- include bundled Service Admin assets for the host shell
- keep the canonical repo-owned `services/` inventory inside the artifact
- prove that Echo Service is acquired from manifest-owned release metadata before use

What ships:
- `.npmrc`
- `README.md`
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `src/`
- `services/`
- `docs/`
- installed `node_modules/`
- bundled admin assets under `.payload/admin/`
- generated `release-artifact.json`

How it works:
- the app repo owns `services/echo-service/service.json`
- that manifest carries the bounded `artifact` block pointing at the Echo Service release assets
- on `install`, Service Lasso downloads and unpacks the matching archive from the manifest metadata
- the app artifact itself does not ship the Echo Service archive preloaded

Honest label:
- **runnable bootstrap-download bundle**

## Runnable preloaded bundle

Artifact:
- `service-lasso-app-web-<version>-preloaded.tar.gz`

Purpose:
- provide a ready-to-run browser-first host with the core runtime already installed
- include bundled Service Admin assets for the host shell
- keep the canonical repo-owned `services/` inventory inside the artifact
- prove that the Echo Service archive is already present before first install/use

What ships:
- everything in the runnable bootstrap-download bundle
- preseeded Echo Service archive under:
  - `.workspace/services/echo-service/.state/artifacts/<releaseTag>/<assetName>`

How it works:
- the app repo still owns the same canonical `services/echo-service/service.json`
- the preloaded artifact seeds the matching archive into the runtime-owned service state before first use
- on `install`, Service Lasso reuses that archive and skips the network fetch

Honest label:
- **runnable preloaded bundle**

## What the release proves

The release now proves:
- the repo owns explicit tracked service metadata under `services/`
- the browser-first host can be packaged repeatably
- the runnable artifact can boot Service Lasso and Service Admin without sibling-repo checkout tricks
- the host shell includes a bounded service listing widget backed by the runtime API
- Echo Service acquisition now depends on manifest-owned archive metadata instead of a generated local wrapper
- bootstrap-download mode installs the service payload before first use
- preloaded mode installs from an already-shipped archive without a first-run download
- GitHub Actions can upload the artifacts and attach them to a timestamped `yyyy.m.d-<shortsha>` release on `main`

## Private package note

This starter depends on the published private core package:
- `@service-lasso/service-lasso@latest`

The `latest` dist-tag is intentional so starter artifacts consume the current manifest-owned install/acquire behavior published by the core repo.

For local or CI installs from GitHub Packages, provide a token with package read access through:
- `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`

The repo `.npmrc` is included in the staged artifacts so the starter knows which registry and scope to use.

## Commands

Stage the artifacts:

```bash
npm run release:artifact
```

Stage and verify the artifacts:

```bash
npm run release:verify
```

## Release version pattern

Releases from `main` use the project timestamped pattern:

- `yyyy.m.d-<shortsha>`

Example:

- `2026.4.23-abcdef1`

## Current expectation

Any application using Service Lasso should keep a tracked `services/` folder in its repo with the service metadata it intends to manage.

This app-web starter now uses that tracked inventory directly for bootstrap-download and preloaded behavior.
